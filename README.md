# xRetry for NUnit
Retry flickering test cases for NUnit and SpecFlow.

[![CI/CD](https://github.com/calrom-jtejero/nRetry.Core/actions/workflows/cicd.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/calrom-jtejero/nRetry.Core/actions/workflows/cicd.yaml)

## When to use this
This is intended for use on flickering tests, where the reason for failure is an external 
dependency and the failure is transient, e.g:
 - HTTP request over the network
 - Database call that could deadlock, timeout etc...

Whenever a test includes real-world infrastructure, particularly when communicated with via the
internet, there is a risk of the test randomly failing so we want to try and run it again. 
This is the intended use case of the library.  

If you have a test that covers some flaky code, where sporadic failures are caused by a bug, 
this library should **not** be used to cover it up!

## Usage: SpecFlow 3
Add the `nRetry.Core.SpecFlowPlugin` nuget package to your project.

nuget.org link: https://www.nuget.org/packages/nRetry.SpecFlowPlugin/

Above any scenario that should be retried, add a `@retry` tag, e.g:
```gherkin
@retry
Scenario: Retry three times by default
	When I increment the default retry count
	Then the default result should be 3
```
This will retry the test up to 3 times by default. You can optionally specify a number of times 
to retry the test in brackets, e.g. `@retry(5)`.  

## Contributing
Feel free to open a pull request! If you want to start any sizeable chunk of work, consider 
opening an issue first to discuss, and make sure nobody else is working on the same problem.  

### Running locally
To run locally, always build `xRetry.NUnit.SpecFlowPlugin` before the tests, to ensure MSBuild
uses the latest version of your changes.  

If you install `make` and go to the `build` directory, you can run the following from the 
terminal to build, run tests and create the nuget packages:
```bash
make build unit-tests-run nuget-create
```
If that works, all is well!
